In some languages, it’s common to use [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.

Python, by contrast, [recommends snake case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case), whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.

In a file called `camel.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.

## Hints
- Recall that a str comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods).
- Much like a `list`, a `str` is `"iterable,"` which means you can iterate over each of its characters in a loop. For instance, if `s` is a `str`, you could print each of its characters, one at a time, with code like:
```python
for c in s:
    print(c, end="")
```

## Demo
```
$ python camel.py                                                               
camelCase: name                                                                 
snake_case: name                                                                
$ python camel.py                                                               
camelCase: firstName                                                            
snake_case: first_name                                                          
$ python camel.py                                                               
camelCase: preferredFirstName                                                   
snake_case: preferred_first_name

## Before You Begin
In directory `camel` run:
```
$ code camel.py
```
In file `camel.py` you will write your programm.

## How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:
- Run your program with `python camel.py`. Type `name` and `press` Enter. Your program should output:
```
name
```
- Run your program with `python camel.py`. Type `firstName` and `press` Enter. Your program should output:
```
first_name
```
- Run your program with `python camel.py`. Type `preferredFirstName` and `press` Enter. Your program should output
```
preferred_first_name
```
