# Tip Calculator

It’s customary to leave a tip for your server after dining in a restaurant, typically an amount equal to 15% or more of your meal’s cost. Here is starter code for your program:

```python
def main():
    dollars = dollars_to_float(input("How much was the meal? "))
    percent = percent_to_float(input("What percentage would you like to tip? "))
    tip = dollars * percent
    print(f"Leave ${tip:.2f}")


def dollars_to_float(d):
    # TODO


def percent_to_float(p):
    # TODO


main()
```
Your task is to write two functions:
- `dollars_to_float`, which should accept a `str` as input (formatted as `$##.##`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), remove the leading `$`, and return the amount as a `float`. For instance, given `$50.00` as input, it should return `50.0`.
- `percent_to_float`, which should accept a `str` as input (formatted as `##%`, wherein each `#` is a decimal digit), remove the trailing `%`, and return the percentage as a `float`. For instance, given `15%` as input, it should return `0.15`.

> Assume that the user will input values in the expected formats.

## Demo
```
$ python tip.py                                                                 
How much was the meal? $50.00                                                   
What percentage would you like to tip? 15%                                      
Leave $7.50                                                                     
$
```

## How to Test
Here’s how to test your code manually:

- Run your program with `python tip.py`. Type `$50.00` and press Enter. Then, type `15%` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Leave $7.50
```
- Run your program with `python tip.py`. Type `$100.00` and press Enter. Then, type `18%` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Leave $18.00
```
- Run your program with `python tip.py`. Type `$15.00` and press Enter. Then, type `25%` and press Enter. Your program should output:
```
Leave $3.75
```
