In season 7, episode 24 of Seinfeld, Kramer visits a bank that promises to give $100 to anyone who isn’t greeted with a “hello.” Kramer is instead greeted with a “hey,” which he insists isn’t a “hello,” and so he asks for $100. The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

In a file called `bank.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output `$0`. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output `$20`. Otherwise, output `$100`. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.

## Hints

- Recall that a `str` comes with quite a few methods, per [docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods)
- Be sure to give $0 not only for “hello” but also “hello there”, “hello, Newman”, and the like.
